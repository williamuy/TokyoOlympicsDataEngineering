# Tokyo Olympics Data Engineering

Welcome to my first data engineering project focused on the Tokyo Olympics dataset and Azure Workspace. Find the demo video here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwIzjCdpQ5M 

## Project Overview

The Tokyo Olympics dataset provided a rich ground for practicing data engineering skills. This project includes:
- **Datasets Used:** Direct links to the datasets or a description of the data used.
- **Data Transformation:** The code and methodologies applied to clean and transform the raw data into a structured format.
- **Data Extraction:** SQL queries developed to extract meaningful insights from the transformed data.

## Repository Contents

- `datasets/` - Contains the raw datasets used in the project.
- `scripts/` - Scripts used for data transformation and cleaning and SQL queries.

## Dashboard

A visual representation of the data is available in the form of an interactive dashboard. This dashboard highlights the key insights and trends derived from the Tokyo Olympics dataset.
