# Tokyo Olympics Data Engineering

Welcome to my first data engineering project focused on the Tokyo Olympics dataset and Azure Workspace.

## Project Overview

This project was focused on using the Azure workspace, rather than the data itself. This project includes:
- **Datasets Used:** [2021 Olympics In Tokyo](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo)
- **Data Transformation:** The code and methodologies applied to clean and transform the raw data into a structured format.
- **Data Extraction:** SQL queries developed to extract meaningful insights from the transformed data.
- **Data Pipelines:** End to end data pipelines where I ingest the data -> Store -> Transform -> Store -> Analyze -> Visualize 
## Repository Contents

- `datasets/` - Contains the raw datasets used in the project.
- `scripts/` - Scripts used for data transformation and cleaning and SQL queries.
